== Introduction

This is my very first page written in *AsciiDoc* and rendered by **Hugo**.  
AsciiDoc is more powerful than Markdown — you get attributes, references, and more.

== Lists

=== Unordered
* Item one
* Item two
* Item three

=== Ordered
. Step one
. Step two
. Step three

== Code Example

Here’s some inline code: `print("Hello World")`.

[source,python]
----
def hello():
    print("Hello, Hugo + AsciiDoc!")
----

== Links and Images

Check out the Hugo docs: https://gohugo.io/[Hugo Official Site].
